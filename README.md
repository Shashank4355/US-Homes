# Analyzing Influences on US Home Prices

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze publicly available data on key factors influencing US home prices over the past 20 years. We aim to build a data science model that explains how various economic, demographic, government policy, housing market dynamics, and external factors have impacted home prices.

## Key Factors Investigated

### Economic Factors
- **Interest rates**
- **Employment and income levels**
- **Inflation**

### Demographic Factors
- **Population growth**
- **Age distribution**
- **Migration patterns**

### Government Policies
- **Tax policies**
- **Zoning regulations**
- **Subsidies and grants**

### Housing Market Dynamics
- **Supply and demand**
- **Construction costs**
- **Real estate market trends**

### External Factors
- **Natural disasters**
- **Economic shocks**

## Steps to Complete the Assignment

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Utilize publicly available datasets from sources such as:
  - Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
  - U.S. Census Bureau
  - Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
  - National Association of Realtors (NAR)
  - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Clean data and handle missing values.
- Normalize or standardize data if required.
- Merge datasets to create a comprehensive dataset spanning the last 20 years.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Use provided Jupyter notebooks:
  - `Main_Factors.ipynb`: Detailed breakdown of main factors affecting home prices with data and visualizations.
  - `Demographic.ipynb`: Examination of demographic factors influencing housing demand and prices.

### Step 4: Model Building
- Select appropriate statistical or machine learning models.
- Refer to `Home_Value.ipynb` for insights and methodologies on modeling home value trends.

### Step 5: Model Evaluation
- Assess model performance using metrics like R-squared and RMSE.
- Validate models using cross-validation techniques.

### Step 6: Interpretation and Reporting
- Interpret model results to explain how each factor impacts home prices.
- Refer to `TCJA.ipynb` for analyzing specific policy impacts (e.g., Tax Cuts and Jobs Act).

### Step 7: Documentation
- Document process, findings, and interpretations in a final report.
- Include visualizations supporting your analysis.

## Deliverables

- Comprehensive dataset combining all relevant factors influencing home prices over the last 20 years.
- Google Colab containing data preprocessing, EDA, model building, and evaluation.
- Final report summarizing findings, including factor influences on home prices and model performance.
